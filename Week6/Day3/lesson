-- EXERCISE

-- If you did the exercise of yesterday, use Emp/Dept database

-- 1. Create a new database, and create the table department

   CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT
      (
         DEPTCODE   SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         DeptName   CHAR(30),
         LOCATION   VARCHAR(33)
      );

-- 2. Create a Boss table with the columns boss_id, boss_name, boss_type (ie.nice, angry, funny ect...), and dept_number:
-- The boss table, has a one to one relationship with the department table:
-- => a department can be managed by only 1 boss, and a boss can manage only 1 department
   CREATE TABLE boss
      (
         boss_id   SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         boss_name  VARCHAR(30),
         boss_type   VARCHAR(50),
		 dept_number INTEGER UNIQUE REFERENCES department (deptcode) 
      );
-- 1. Add a few bosses : one for the finance dept, one for sales and one for marketing
-- 2. What is the type and name of the boss of the dept Finance (show the dept name, not the dept id)
INSERT INTO department (deptname, location)
VALUES
('Finance_dep', '2 floor'),
('Sales_dep', '1 floor'),
('Marketing_dep', '3 floor')
RETURNING *

INSERT INTO boss (boss_name, boss_type, dept_number)
VALUES
('Tom Smith', 'angry', (SELECT deptcode FROM department WHERE deptname='Finance_dep')),
('John Black', 'nice', (SELECT deptcode FROM department WHERE deptname='Sales_dep')),
('Sarah Connor', 'pleasant', (SELECT deptcode FROM department WHERE deptname='Marketing_dep'))
RETURNING *

SELECT boss_name, boss_type
FROM department
inner JOIN boss
ON department.deptcode = boss.dept_number
where DeptName = 'Finance_dep';

select * from department;
