select item_name, price from items order by price;
-- Items with a price above 80 (80 included), ordered by price (highest to lowest).
select item_name, price from items where price >= '80' order by price;
-- The first 3 customers in alphabetical order of the first name (A-Z) – exclude the primary key column from the results.
select first_name, last_name from customers order by first_name asc limit 3;
-- All last names (no other columns!), in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A)
select last_name from customers order by last_name desc;
