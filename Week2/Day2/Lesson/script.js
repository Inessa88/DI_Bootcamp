// Exercise 1 Conditionals

//Make a keyless car!

//This car will only let you drive if you are over 18. Make it do the following:

//Using prompt() and alert(), ask a user for their age.

//IF they say they are below 18, respond with: "Sorry, you are too young to drive this car. Powering off
//IF they say they are 18, respond with: "Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!
//IF they say they are over 18, respond with: "Powering On. Enjoy the ride!"

} else if (age === 18) {
    alert('Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!');
} else {
    alert('Powering On. Enjoy the ride!');
}
